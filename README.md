# FlatOut 2 Pull-Back Cars

You know those pull-back toy cars that you drive backwards to wind up?

Inspired by petar's anti-nitro, this mod replaces the boosting mechanic with a pull-back system

Holding `CTRL` will pull the car backwards, charging up a boost. Let go to shoot forward

The speed you go depends on how long you spent going backwards

In the settings you can adjust things like which button winds up, how quickly the boost charges up, the speed you go when pulling back, and the maximum boost you can charge up before it automatically shoots

## Building
I used Visual Studio on Windows

You'll need my fork of Sewer's FlatOut 2 SDK
